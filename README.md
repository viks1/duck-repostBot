- reposts messages to a custom channel 
- keeps track of how many reacters the message has got
- provides a link to jump to the original message
- has duplicate protection
# Running your own instance
- in the main.py file at the last line add your BOT token from https://discord.com/developers/applications, paste it in bot.run('yourTokenHere')
- at reaction.emoji != 'ðŸ“Œ' add your own emoji or use the default one
- change the required amount of reactions directly in the code or using the !pins x command (where x is the desired amount, you have to be an Administrator)
- at name='pins' you can change the repost channel
